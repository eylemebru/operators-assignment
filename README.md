# operators-assignment

1. Create an Employee Class:
   - Create an Employee class with the following properties: Id, FirstName, and LastName.

2. Overload the "==" Operator:
   - In the Employee class, overload the == operator so that it checks if two Employee objects are equal by comparing their Id property.
   - Remember: Comparison operators must be overloaded in pairs.

3. Instantiating Objects:
   - In the Program.cs file, instantiate two objects of the Employee class and assign values to their properties.
   - Then compare the two Employee objects using the newly overloaded operators and display the results.

4. Add Comments to Your Code:
   - Add comments to each line or block of your code to explain what it does exactly so that another developer could read and understand your code.
